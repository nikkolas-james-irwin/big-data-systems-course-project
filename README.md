# Containerized Amazon Recommender System (CARS)

* CARS is an academic project that creates a recommender system using Apache Spark's PySpark API.
* The recommender system is implemented using the [ALS algorithm](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-collaborative-filtering.html) found in the MlLib library.
* The ALS algorithm is used to provide recommendations based on the Amazon 2018 dataset provided by UCSD.
* For development/testing we used the 5-core (14.3gb) - subset of the data in which all users and items have at least 5 reviews (75.26 million total reviews across all datasets).

### Project Goals

Our goals are broken down in the bulleted-list below. This list it not exhaustive, however, it does cover the primary goals of this project.

* **Isolate** our [Python](https://www.python.org) application with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html).
* **Manage** package dependencies with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html).
* **Create** a portable application that can be easily distributed and built by all team members using [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
* **Use** [Spark](https://spark.apache.org), a unified analytics engine for big data to perform processing on large datasets of Amazon review data.
* **Prototype** and collaborate on the applications implementation with [Microsoft Visual Studio Code Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org).
* **Automate** our container and simplify the building and running of our container with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com).
* **Provide** modern analytics insights through visually appealing insights with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com).
* **Manage** the project's development and deployment with [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com/about).

### Example Usage

Follow the steps **in order** to build the application and deploy the Jupyter Notebook. If followed properly, you will be able to write your own application code in the **_/home/jovyan/work/_** directory in a new Jupyter Notebook file or run our application using whichever dataset(s) you have downloaded to your local machine.

1. Download one or more **review** datasets from here: [Amazon Review Data (2018)](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html).
   * Place the review dataset JSON file in the project directory (same directory as the Dockerfile).
   * Example data and it's structure from the **Video_Games_5.json** dataset is shown below.
   * **Only the first 10 lines of this dataset are shown, the entire file has 497,577 reviews**.

My main beef with this it requires an internet connection. Other than that it has wonderful artistry and graphics. It is the same as anno 1701 but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals. I recoment the deep ocean expansion or complete if you get this. I found the ai instructor a little corny but other than that the game has some real polish.

    ```

2. Build the image with Docker using the Dockerfile.

    ```docker
    docker image build -t cars:latest .
    ```

3. Verify that the image was built successfully.

    ```docker
    docker image ls
    ```

4. Create the Docker container and mount the volume to ensure that work performed is saved regardless of the lifecycle/state of the container.

    ```docker
    docker container run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -it --name cars_container --mount source=cars_local_volume,target=/home/jovyan/work cars
    ```

5. Verify that the volume was initialized successfully.

    ```docker
    docker volume ls
    ```
6. Verify that the container was created successfully and is currently running.

    ```docker
    docker container ls
    ```

7. Get the URL and token value for the Jupyter Notebook.

    ```docker
    docker container exec -it cars_container jupyter notebook list
    ```

8. Copy data sets from local machine to cars container (from outside the container).
    
    ```docker
    docker cp <dataset_file.json> cars_container:/home/jovyan/work/
    ```

9. Run the program via the command line.

    ```python
    python recommender.py <optional arguments>
    ```
